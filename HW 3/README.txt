HW 3

In the zip file there are 4 matlab codes (.m) files, a pdf file for report and this txt file.

Code Files:

hw3_q2a.m : [bestConfusion, accuracy] = hw3_q2a(dataPath)
This code is for question 2 part a. It takes as input, the path of the folder in which clustering.csv is placed.
It gives bestConfusion, accuracy as outputs.
bestConfusion is the confusion matrix of the picked result. 
accuracy is the accuracy of the picked result. It is in percent.
It produces a plot for visualization of the given dataset in 2D.

hw3_q2c.m : [bestConfusion, accuracy] = hw3_q2c(dataPath)
This code is for question 2 part c. It takes as input, the path of the folder in which clustering.csv is placed.
It gives bestConfusion, accuracy as outputs.
bestConfusion is the confusion matrix of the picked result. 
accuracy is the accuracy of the picked result. It is in percent.
It produces two plots for visualization of the given dataset in 2D and in 3D.

hw3_q3a.m : hw3_q3a (dataPath)
This code is for question 3 part a. It takes as input, the path of the folder in which digits.csv is placed.
It produces a plot for the eigenvalues of corresponding principal components in descending order. 

hw3_q3b.m : hw3_q3b (dataPath)
This code is for question 3 part b. It takes as input, the path of the folder in which digits.csv is placed.
It produces 10 different plots to show top 5 and bottom 5 principal components. 

You can run these codes like in the below examples:
[bestConfusion, accuracy] = hw3_q2a('C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\MESUD\6. Semester\CS 464 Machine Learning\HW 3');
[bestConfusion, accuracy] = hw3_q2c('C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\MESUD\6. Semester\CS 464 Machine Learning\HW 3');
hw3_q3a('C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\MESUD\6. Semester\CS 464 Machine Learning\HW 3');
hw3_q3c('C:\Users\lenovo\Desktop\MESUD\6. Semester\CS 464 Machine Learning\HW 3');

HW3_Report_02_21302479_Toker_OmerMesud.pdf is the report for this homework.
